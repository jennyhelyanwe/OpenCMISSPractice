OpenCMISS Finite Elasticity Examples
====================================

The capabilities available in the OpenCMISS platform for solving finite elasticity
problems are demonstrated here. The examples shown are designed to guide the reader
through toy problems of increasing complexity which will aide in their understanding 
of OpenCMISS. 

The examples have been grouped firstly in terms of the complexity of geometry, 
and subsequently in terms of basis function types.
