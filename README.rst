OpenCMISS Finite Elasticity Examples
====================================

The capabilities available in the OpenCMISS platform for solving finite elasticity
problems are demonstrated here. The examples shown are designed to guide the reader
through toy problems of increasing complexity which will aid in their understanding 
of OpenCMISS. 

The examples have been grouped in terms of the complexity of geometry for convenience
sake, though an exploration could be found on the use of different basis functions, 
mesh refinements, constitutive models and boundary conditions under each type of 
geometry.
