Trilinear Uniaxial Extension - Isotropic Mooney-Rivlin
======================================================

This is arguably the simplest problem we could construct using the unit cube geometry. 
Therefore this is a good place to start off with the basics of how OpenCMISS mechanics
problems are set up. 

First let's try importing a code snippet

.. literalinclude:: lib.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :start-after: !DOC-START environment set-up declarations
   :end-before: !DOC-END environment set-up declarations
