Cylindrical Geometry
====================

The main attraction of building a toy problem with a cylindrical shape is that we can
check the solution against analytical solutions. The cylinder is also one step away from 
building a model of the left ventricle of the heart, and so it is a good stepping stone
to understanding circumferential, tangential and longitudinal coordinate axes.
